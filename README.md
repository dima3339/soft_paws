Questions
Does OSSU offer a degree?
No. OSSU creates guides to resources that will empower you to learn the curriculum of an undergraduate degree. Individuals who used to be involved in OSSU may be working with other organizations to offer degrees, but Open Source Society University is not involved in those efforts.

How can I review the math prerequisites?
Many OSSU students choose to review math topics that they have not studied recently. OSSU recommends students use Khan Academy for such a review. Below are links to topic assessments. After taking an assessment, you should have a clear idea what topics to study, and resources on Khan Academy to use.
